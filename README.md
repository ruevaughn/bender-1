### Description

> In this puzzle, you have to parse, store and manipulate two-dimensional arrays that are the bases for 2D problems. 
> You also have to implement a simple but complete Finite State Machine and learn about this concept.

#### Statement

The goal of the puzzle is to help Bender the robot to go through the city. You have to decide what movement it will do next, based on its previous moves and the environment (obstacles). Read carefully the rules for the displacement of the robot and how to modelize the map of the city.

#### Story

Bender, depressed since its artificial intelligence has been diminished, roams on the streets to find the nearest suicide booth. In order to save the robot, you are entrusted with the task of forecasting the path Bender will take, so we can intercept him. You will have at your disposal the logics of the robot's displacements. What are you still doing here ? Run to Bender's rescue !
